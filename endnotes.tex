\chapter{End notes}
\label{end-notes}
In the previous chapters I have presented my current research projects.
These projects are in various stages of completions.

I believe that my South Africa paper provides an interesting opportunity to exploit the data from the household survey,
done before and after a highly relevant policy change.
Especially since the methodology and location are the same as in \textcite{duflo2000child, duflo2003grandmothers}.
In addition to this there is now a third data wave which has become available.
This provides us with more data, and mostly the opportunity to use more interesting methodology.
The text of the paper still has to be written. 

The discussion of \textcite{morris1998unique} is in a very early stage.
I have looked at the paper in detail, I have also done a brief analysis of my main critique,
namely the conflation of risk (quantifiable) and Knightian uncertainty (unquantifiable).
However, I would like to present a worked out example which demonstrates how this convolution leads to the main result of the paper.
In addition to this, this example should demonstrate how only a part of the `ripe for attack' region is solved for the unique equilibrium.

Finally, relating to Bitcoin \parencite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}, I think that there is a enormous potential for uncontrolled low-cost remittances using Bitcoin. I would like to analyse the spread of this. I propose to follow the spread of applications for platforms which are popular in developing economies.

At this point, three out of four of the previously discussed research projects are some form of a replication of prior work. As replications they are mostly critiques of others' work, rather than constructive ideas. This is mostly a result of the fact that these projects progress faster. For this reason, these research projects have progressed more than the projects which are primarily based on my own ideas. However, it is my attention to shift the focus of my thesis to include more original work. Here I present two more ideas which are too preliminary to include in the main body of the text, but are based on my own work.

Firstly, I was in charge of setting up a baseline diagnostic into security perceptions in Conakry, Guinea. This diagnostic will be used to analyse the impact of a police reform conducted here. The reform constitutes of the implementation of a model of `police de proximitee'. The baseline consist of 4500 interviews using smartphones in the commune of Conakry as well a large number of interviews in N'Zerekore (east Guinea). Some time after the implementation of the police reform as follow up study will be conducted. I propose to conduct an impact evaluation using the results from the studies in which I have taken and will take part.

Secondly, I have previously studied philosophy of science in my bachelors in Theoretical Philosophy. I would like to write one paper about an issue relating to this. In particular I would like to at the effect of outliers. The effect how these outliers has extensively been discussed in contexts such as finance and international economics \parencite{taleb2010black,   sornette2009dragon},  as well as individual behaviour \parencite{kahneman2011thinking}. I would like to see how these principles affect research in development microeconomics.

In this document I have tried to give a description of my research projects. None of these projects are near completion and many are in fact in a very early stage. The purpose of this has been to describe the direction I am taking with my thesis, and to receive feedback on this. As a result of this being work in progress, the articles are still incomplete, this includes lacking the proper attribution of ideas using citations.
